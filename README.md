## Inspiration
Vaccine roll-outs for COVID-19 have begun but there is a lot of apprehension in the minds of people, some myths around vaccination as well as general curiosity about the best vaccine for yourself and your family. Through the rumors and false information spreading around the media, many are anxious and worried about what is being injected into their bodies, even though it may be for the best. **Covax-19** makes it easier to track your own health post-vaccine.

## What it does
Users all around the world can input their symptoms and experiences with the Covid-19 vaccine. They can list their pre-existing conditions, age, and what company’s vaccine they received in order for others to read through and review for their own knowledge. Our web-app populates reviews on the interface in a user-friendly theme.

## How we built it
Our team used Figma for wireframing, creating a user flow and brainstorming the elements the app should have. We used Figma to create the detailed prototype to make the coding stage straight-forward and efficient. From there, the branding and logo was created in Adobe Illustrator. Communicating over Discord, our team set up our Git repo and began creating our React.JS web app. We used MongoDB for the database, Bootstrap-React for the layout, and CSS for custom styling. We’ve also used qnamaker.ai to store FAQ questions and deployed the chatbot using Microsoft Azure to allow more of a fun and interactive element.

## Challenges we ran into
Though an incredible hackathon weekend learning new languages and frameworks, there are usually challenges when it comes to remote working. Our hack team is from all around the world, different time zones and internet stability. Our passionate teammates have sacrificed sleep or changed their sleeping schedules to accommodate our hacking! We ran into some issues with connectivity and bugs, yet used Discord to hop in and out of different channels to support each other and make sure we are all working up to speed. Teamwork thankfully combatted all the challenges we faced.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We had a rather diverse set of skills among us, so we figured out how to share tasks. Our team members became both mentors and mentees for each other! Our newer hackers learned how to use React.JS and Github, and others adapted to new remote platforms very easily. We are incredibly proud of submitting a finished prototype to HackUCI, one that targets a concept in everyone’s day to day life, and an app that people can use to ensure comfort and oneness with others during this pandemic.

## What we learned
All our team members learned something new, whether it be design, code, or practical skills such as organization and remote communication. We brushed up on React.JS, Git command lines, as well as working efficiently with each other despite our timezone and location barriers.

## What's next for Covax-19
Covax-19 has an immense future, with a long way to go! We hope to have SMS notifications to keep users updated on their symptoms and keep a continuous communication stream through their journey of receiving vaccines. We’d like to have a data visualization dashboard where locations and vaccines people have taken can be seen in real-time. A feature for filtering reviews based on parameters like age, location, previous conditions needs to be implemented too. In this new pandemic world, many people are anxious about new vaccines, their symptoms, and their overall health. By gathering factual data and analyzing their symptoms, Covax-19 can update users and reassure them that their symptoms are normal.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
